The `ramboseli` package provides a set of small functions and utilities for R that can be shared among members of the Amboseli Baboon Research Project. There are instructions for using the package below.

<br>
<br>

# Installation

To install this package, you first need to install the `devtools` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("devtools")
```

Then, you can install the latest development version of `ramboseli` from github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  devtools::install_github("amboseli/ramboseli")
```

After you have installed the package once, you can simply load it in the future using:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE} 
  library(ramboseli)
```

# Instructions for ceating an SSH tunnel

Some (but not all!) functions in this package query the babase database directly. This allows you to pull "live" data from babase directly into R without going through the intermediate steps of writing queries in SQL, saving the results, and reading that data into R from static CSV files.

To use these functions, you must create an SSH tunnel to the database server. The instructions below explain how to do this.

_It's important to note that you can use this package to calculate, e.g., sociality indices, without creating the SSH tunnel!_

<br>

### Getting a login

First, you must have a username and password for the babase database. If you're here and you're affiliated with the ABRP, you probably have this already. To create the tunnel, you must ALSO request a login to SSH into the server, papio.biology.duke.edu. _<span style="color: red;">Most people do NOT have this&mdash;it must be requested from Jake.</span>_

<br>

### Creating a Tunnel on Mac/Linux

The simplest way to create the tunnel on a Mac/Linux is to open a terminal window and type the following, substituting your actual username for "YourUsername":

```
ssh -f YourUsername@papio.biology.duke.edu -L 2222:localhost:5432 -N
```

Your Terminal window should then prompt you for your password for papio.biology.duke.edu. After that's entered, a message appears indicating that the connection has been made:

```
###############################################################################
# You are about to access a Duke University computer network that is intended #
# for authorized users only. You should have no expectation of privacy in     #
# your use of this network. Use of this network constitutes consent to        #
# monitoring, retrieval, and disclosure of any information stored within the  #
# network for any purpose including criminal prosecution.                     #
###############################################################################
```

Once this is done, the tunnel has been created. Keep the Terminal window open and return to R for your analysis.

### Creating a Tunnel on Windows

This is a little more complicated. I don't have a Windows machine to test it on, but I _think_ this should work. Please let me know ( [camposfa@gmail.com](mailto:camposfa@gmail.com) ) if you try and can't get it to work properly.

- Download and install PuTTY, a free SSH client for Windows: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html 
    a. Scroll down the page and find the link for the appropriate Windows Installer. It should be called something like `putty-0.70-installer.msi` (version number might differ).
    b. Download and install the software.
    c. Once the installation is complete, note the location where PuTTY was installed. It should be in: 
        i. `C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\` or 
        ii. `C:\Program Files\PuTTY\`

- Create a Batch File that will Open the SSH Tunnel
    a. Open Notepad or any other text editor.
    b. Type in the following text, all on one line, _including the quotation marks,_ replacing "YourUsername" with your username, and replacing "YourPassword" with your password. Note that you may need to replace "Program Files" with "Program Files (x86)"

```
"C:\Program Files\PuTTY\plink.exe" ssh -f YourUsername@papio.biology.duke.edu -L 2222:localhost:5432 -N -pw YourPassword"
```
Alternatively, if you don't want to save your password in a plain text file, use the following text that will prompt you for your password each time you run the batch file.
```
"C:\Program Files\PuTTY\plink.exe" ssh -f YourUsername@papio.biology.duke.edu -L 2222:localhost:5432 -N"
```

- Save the batch file somewhere convenient with a name like "babase_tunnel.bat""

- Open the SSH Tunnel
    a. Run the batch file that you just created by double clicking on it.
    b. If there is an error, the window will close on its own, you will have no tunnel, and you will need to correct the errors!
    c. If you are successful, a command prompt window will display the text in the batch file, along with a message.
    d. You can leave this window open or minimize it, but don't close it until you want to close the tunnel!

<br>


### Additional Notes

There are shortcuts that can make this process more streamlined, including:

- Using an SSH key and a .pgpass file rather than a password so that you don't have to type the password each time.
- Setting up an alias in your .bash_profile for the tunnel commands.

Fernando can help with this if you're interested.

Every so often, when the connection is left idle, the tunnel seems to get corrupted. Often, you can simply reconnect using the same steps as above. Sometimes reconnecting doesn't work. In those cases, you can "kill" the corrupted tunnel by typing the following into Terminal:

```
ps aux | grep ssh
```

A list of processes should appear in the window, similar to this

```
fac13            23128   0.0  0.0  2445836    260   ??  S    25Jun18   0:00.02 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -l
fac13            14419   0.0  0.0  2432804    776 s000  S+   12:30PM   0:00.00 grep ssh
fac13            14205   0.0  0.0  2462536    904   ??  Ss   12:27PM   0:00.00 ssh -f fac13@papio.biology.duke.edu -L 2222:localhost:5432 -N
```
The last process is the corrupted tunnel. Kill it by typing `kill` followed by the process ID number: 

```
kill 14205
```

# Reading data from babase 

With the tunnel created, we can now connect to babase.

```{r hidden-connection, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  library(ramboseli)
  library(tidyverse)
  library(dbplyr)

  # You will need to change user to your personal babase login AND get your password
  babase <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgreSQL::PostgreSQL(),
                           host = "localhost",
                           port = 2222,
                           user = "fac13",
                           dbname = "babase")
```

```{r connect-to-babase, eval=FALSE}
  library(ramboseli)
  library(tidyverse)
  library(dbplyr)

  # You will need to change user to your personal babase login AND get your password
  # One approach to doing that is through Rstudio
  # You could also just type it in your script, but that's not recommended for security.
  babase <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgreSQL::PostgreSQL(),
                           host = "localhost",
                           port = 2222,
                           user = "fac13",
                           dbname = "babase",
                           password = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password"))
```

Now we can create a connection to any table or view in babase. Here's an example for the biograph table.

```{r read-biograph}
biograph <- tbl(babase, "biograph")
```

You now have a live connection to the biograph table, stored as an object in R. It's important to note that this hasn't pulled in all the data, only the first few rows. Let's see what this objects looks like:

```{r print-biograph}
biograph
```

We can perform basic queries and joins on the the table using the `dplyr` and `dbplyr` packages. There's a lot more information [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbplyr/vignettes/dbplyr.html).

If we want to pull in all the data into our current R environment as a normal data frame, we can use the function `collect`.

```{r collect-biograph}
biograph_l <- collect(biograph)
biograph_l
```

Need a table that in a different schema? Use the `in_schema` function:

```{r schema}
all_ranks <- tbl(babase, in_schema("babase_pending", "ALL_RANKS"))
collect(all_ranks)
```

# Best practices for using `ramboseli` functions

1. Supply a database connection and no tables to obtain data directly through queries
  
    * Uses most up-to-date data
    * Use when carrying out exploratory analysis
    * Not reproducible
  
2. Supply tables from the R environment and no database connection

    * Uses static input files (a "snapshot" of specific babase tables)
    * Reqires that user queries database first to produce static files and loads them into R environment
    * Use for final analysis if you need reproducibility
